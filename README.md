# The OpenCode project
The Opencode project is a crowdsourced code editor, aiming to be designed and mantained by the Github community (and me).
This project is aimed to be COMPLETELY open source and designed by YOU and other members of the Github community.
# Targets
By the stable release (not alpha or beta) I want:

-Support for Python, BASH, Go, JS, HTML and Java at minimum.

-A full GUI

-The ability to execute and analyze results from the code in-app

-A debugging tool/mode

-Support for Windows, Linux, and MacOS

-Most, if not all the other ideas you guys come up with

# How to Contribute
Commit a file... please. This is my first project and I have high hopes for it. However, It won't go very far without YOU, so please help with this project. Helping can be as simple as reporting a bug or recomending a feature. Have a nice day!
